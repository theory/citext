Revision history for PostgreSQL data type CITEXT.

2.0.3

2.0.2   2011-07-16T20:16:13
      - Fixed formatting of the documentation and removed the "Installation"
        section, since that's covered by the README.
      - Removed Subversion `$Id` leftover cruft.
      - Fixed PostgreSQL version requirement in `META.json` to include any
        release of 8.3. It has been requiring only 8.3.0.

2.0.1   2011-06-28T05:08:07
      - First release on PGXN for PostgreSQL 8.3 only.
      - Updated regression tests to reflect change in the core version.
      - Made `regexp_matches()` return `SETOF TEXT[]` like the underlying text
        version does. Thanks to Tom Lane for the spot!
      - Reorganized source code for preferred layout.
      - Added `META.json` to support PGXN.
      - Renamed `README.citext` to `doc/citext.md` and added `README.md`.
      - Fixed failing tests when PostgreSQL isn't compiled with libxml2
        support.
      - Moved repository to [GitHub](https://github.com/theory/citext/).
      - Removed setting of `search_path` in the SQL scripts. The README
        describes a better way to install citext into a specific schema.

2.0.0   2008-09-14 22:20:03
      - Initial public release to pgsql-hackers only.
